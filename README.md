# ðŸš€ Flask App with CI/CD using GitHub Actions

This repository contains a simple **Flask API** with two endpoints and a complete **CI/CD pipeline** powered by GitHub Actions.  
The goal is to demonstrate how Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) can be set up for a Python project using Docker and GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
